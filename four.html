        I am not religious, and thus don't have a set of guiding principles to rely on. So, I've decided to keep an evolving collection
        of books, which I so creatively call the "4 Books". I keep these on my desk and spend a few minutes each day paging re-reading
        pages as necessary. As my priorities change, so will the layout of my 4 Books.
