        What is this page? Glad you asked. My sophomore fall I took a Cybersecurity Ethics course. One of the most impactful readings I engaged in was 
            <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/how-tech-leaders-delivered-us-into-evil-john-naughton">this one</a> by John Naughton. 
            Naughton writes that, “the new masters of our universe are people who are essentially only half-educated,” 
            and that if they had been fully educated, they may have had more foresight onto the problems that could arise from 
            their technologies. As someone who is working toward a STEM-focused undergraduate education, I recognize that one 
            of my limitations is that I will not be able to take as many humanities and ethics courses. Thus, I’ve made it 
            my responsibility to self educate myself on these topics. Here are the books I've gotten the most value from while attending college, categorized
            by genre, accomapnied with a (hopefully) intriguing description.
