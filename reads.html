            Journalist John Naughton writes in  <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/how-tech-leaders-delivered-us-into-evil-john-naughton">this piece</a> that,
            “the new masters of our universe are people who are essentially only half-educated.” If they had been fully educated, 
            they may have had more foresight about the problems that could arise from 
            their technologies. As someone pursuing a STEM-focused undergraduate education, I recognize that one 
            of my limitations is that I will not be able to engage with many humanities, art, and "real world knowledge" courses.
